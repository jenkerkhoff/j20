 <p><b> October 19</p></b>
 <p>OMG my first rioting cases are now November 15 - pushed up from November 20.  I have so much to do.  Cut my hair, get my nails done, buy another purse, make up some more stories, find more evidence because my case is weak.</p>
 <p> I mean, I never really believed this day would come.  I thought they'd all take pleas after I charged them with 8 felonies.  They're all sticking together.  Ugh.</p>
 
 <p><b> October 11, 2017 </b></P>
 So yesterday was rough.  Lynn (that's the judge) was a little tough on me and the defense attorneys just don't understand how much pressure I'm under.  But, it's okay, because I think I prevailed.  I told the judge I was doxxed (that means someone writes about you on the internet).  I wouldn't tell her the website, so I'm really hoping no one googles my name. 
 </p><p>I think I gained some sympathy points with Lynne and won my battle.  I also told her if the anarchists are able to release the footage, it'll affect the juror pool because they'll change the videos to make them look good.  I didn't tell Lynne about any of the videos the police changed. </p>

<p>I'm so nervous.  Tomorrow, I have to argue in court about protective orders.  I just don't understand why everyone wants their information released. It's just not fair. I really like to keep that hidden because I really don't want the media to show it. If they do, it will of course make the jury angry because well, you know, it's the liberal media.</p>
<p> I'm also a little nervous because John argued the last big hearing and he was so good.  Even though I'm his boss, I just don't think I can compete with him. Well, I'll try my best.  That's what I was taught to do.</p>
<p> I'll let my fanclub know how it goes tomorrow.</p>

<p>Happy birthday to me!  For my birthday, I started this blog to chronicle my adventures trying to put anarchists in jail.  I hope I win.</p>
