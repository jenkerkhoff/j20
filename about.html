<p>Ever since I asked to prosecute the J20 protesters, there's been a lot of bad information circulating about me.  So, here's my opportunity to clear that all up. I'm going to be brutally honest here, so hold on tight!</P>

<ul> 
<p><li>I'm an Assistant US Attorneya in the District of Columbia, and the deputy chief of the felony division</li></p>
<p><li>I live in Alexandria, Virginia.</li></p>
<p><li>I'm married to Nate who just got a promotion - I'm really proud of him.</li></p>
<p><li>I was born September 2. I won't tell you the year, but not really over the hill.  Only kind of over the hill.</li></p>
<p><li>I have a Virgo tattoo - some people say it looks trashy, but I can't see it because it's on my shoulder.</li></p>
<p><li>I gave money to Republican candidates.</li></p>
<p><li>I don't like anarchists.  They advocate for a world where everyone is free of leaders.  I don't like that. I like our leader Trump.</li></p>
<p><li>I met Jeff Sessions and he was wonderful. I love working for him.  He gives me so many resources to put all these people away.</li></p>
<p><li>I really like working with John Borchert.  He's so smart and eloquent.  I wish I could be likeable by a jury.</li></p>
<p><li>Sometimes I lie about how much work I have to do, but only because I really really want Judge Liebovitz to like me.  She's such a powerful woman. One day I'll get to be a judge like her and send even more people to jail.</li></p>
<p><li>I don't follow up on things Judge Liebovitz tells me to do around Discovery, because I don't really understand. Plus, she helps me out a lot and I really like that.</li></p>
<p><li>I didn't actually read the DC code.  That's why I accidentally charged all those anarchists with the wrong APO charge.  But the judge is so kind, she often tries my case for me, so it's okay.  <i>Let's keep this as our little secret.</i></li></p>
<p><li>My favorite coffee is Compass Coffee at 7th and F St NW.  I like to get lattes.</li></p>
<p><li>I enjoy shopping at the Trader Joes in Clarendon.  My favorite thing to buy is those sparkling water drinks.</li></p>
<p><li>I went to Law School at GW</li></p>
<p><li>I have 31 purses - 1 for each day of the month.  I sort them in my walk-in closet.  My favorite one is red, but not because I'm a communist.  I like red because it's on the Amercian flag and America is the greatest country on earth.</li></p>
<p><li>A lot of people think I like wearing heels.  I don't.  I go to court in flip flops, then change into heels before the judge comes in.</li></p>
<p><li> My nicknames include: Jen, Jenny, and JennyK</li></p>
<p><li>I still have a landline: 202-965-1260</li></p>
