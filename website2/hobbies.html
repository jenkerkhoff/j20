<p><h3>Shopping</h3></P>
<p>I love shopping at Ann Taylor, Lord and Taylor's and Nordstrom.  You won't find me at any of their discount varieties.  A girl's gotta look good for the judge and jury. </p>

<p><h3>Running</h3></p>
<p>I like running.  I imagine myself running down the bad guys.</p>
<p>I ran the <a href="http://results.active.com/events/2011-national-police-week-5k/team-results">National Police Week 5K</a> in 2011 on the US Attorney's team.  We placed 13th of the teams and I finished in 23:35.</p>
<p> That was an improvement over the <a href="https://arlington911race.com/2006-results/">2006 Police and Fire 5K</a> when I finished in 24:51.</p>
<p>But in 2014, I had a rough start and finished the <a href="http://www.runwashington.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/PW5k_TEAMS.txt">National Police Week 5K</a> in 28:54.  I came in last (again) on my team.</p>

<p><h3>Arguing</h3></p>
<p>I'm the deputy chief of the felony division.  Enough said. I just wish I was good at it...</p><p></p>

<p><h3>Romance Novels</h3></p>
<p>The trashier, the better. My real life can suck.</p>
