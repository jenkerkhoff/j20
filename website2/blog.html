<p>I'm so nervous.  Tomorrow, I have to argue in court about protective orders.  I just don't understand why everyone wants their information released. It's just not fair. I really like to keep that hidden because I really don't want the media to show it. If they do, it will of course make the jury angry because well, you know, it's the liberal media.</p>
<p> I'm also a little nervous because John argued the last big hearing and he was so good.  Even though I'm his boss, I just don't think I can compete with him. Well, I'll try my best.  That's what I was taught to do.</p>
<p> I'll let my fanclub know how it goes tomorrow.</p>

<p>Happy birthday to me!  For my birthday, I started this blog to chronicle my adventures trying to put anarchists in jail.  I hope I win.</p>
